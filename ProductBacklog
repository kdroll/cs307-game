Product Backlog
Problem Statement:
There is currently a high demand for video games in the entertainment industry. We aim to create a 2D top-down role playing action video game with software that meets this demand and differentiates from other software by incorporating elements of random level generation, artificially intelligent enemies, and a simple but rewarding progression system. 

Background Information:
There are many popular 2-D top-down games, such as Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Binding of Isaac, et cetera. These games all have varying degrees of story, RPG elements, and action. Project Trials excels at each of these elements individually; put together they create a game that is accessible and fun for all ages. Limitations of games in the industry today mostly involve a sacrifice of either an engaging story or satisfying game play; it is hard to accomplish both. Project Trails incorporates both of these elements without significant sacrifice. Project Trails’ story keeps you coming back with its unobtrusive and simple choose your own adventure storyline, where the user decides the way the story progresses by in game decisions. Project Trails allows the user to improve armor, movement speed, and attack power based on experience points earned. At the end of each level a decision must be made by the player to choose one of two bonuses that will decide the build of their character. The action of Project Trails will revolve around the idea of a fast paced weapon and item pickup system which will allow the user to micromanage the character’s attack style and attributes.
