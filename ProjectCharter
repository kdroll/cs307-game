Problem Statement:
There is currently a high demand for video games in the entertainment industry. We aim to
create video game software that meets this demand and differentiates from other software by
incorporating elements of unique, ambitious storytelling with fast­paced, top­down action
gameplay.

Project Objectives:
1. Provide story through which player will advance in a linear fashion.
2. Create an engaging world, including a soundtrack, for the player to experience
3. Develop fast­paced and intense action gameplay.
4. Develop and implement artificially intelligent enemies to challenge the player.
5. Implement role­playing elements by allowing player to choose their own playstyle.
